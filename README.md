**COVID-19 Global Data Analysis**
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to extract meaningful insights and trends.  
It focuses on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, death rates, recovery rates, and active cases across countries and continents.

**Features**
- Calculates key statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlation between confirmed cases and deaths.  
- Identifies high-risk countries with death rate > 5%.  
- Categorizes countries into quartiles based on confirmed cases.  
- Flags countries with above-average confirmed cases.  
- Computes active cases and severity indices.  
- Visualizes trends using scatter plots, bar charts, and time-series line plots.  
- Allows continent-level analysis for average death and recovery rates.  

**Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- CSV datasets from public sources (e.g., Kaggle COVID-19 datasets)  


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Load the CSV dataset and run analysis scripts to:

Compute statistics

Generate high-risk flags

Create quartiles and normalized metrics

Plot visualizations

Future Improvements
Add predictive modeling for case growth and recovery trends.


Integrate interactive dashboards for real-time visualization.

Include vaccination data and regional breakdowns for deeper insights.
