## Inline Math

```````````````````````````````` example
The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$
with $a\neq b$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$.
.
<p>The homomorphism <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is injective if and only if its kernel is only the
singleton set <span class="math">\(e_G\)</span>, because otherwise <span class="math">\(\exists a,b\in G\)</span>
with <span class="math">\(a\neq b\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(f(a)=f(b)\)</span>.</p>
